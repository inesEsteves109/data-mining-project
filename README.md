# data-mining-project

## Data mining project done by group 60

The purpose of this project was to enable AIAI Airline to better understand and classify customers based on the data. Based on the value as well as the engagement level of the customers, the airline was able to develop profiles of three main categories of customers based on their value, loyalty, and behaviors.

The first group is the airline’s top customers. These are people who earn a good income, are frequent flyers, and have been with the loyalty program for a long time. The aim for this group is to satisfy them and leverage them. The strategies for segment may include special loyalty tiers, personalized offers, premium services, and strategies to maintain loyalty, reduce churn risk, and increase their overall contribution.

The second category involves customers who have an average profile. They earn medium incomes, travel less frequently, and also do not interact frequently with the reward program. They are regular customers, but they have the potential to be more valuable to the airline. In this category, most customers are youth and students who are very sensitive to promotions and discounts and are more receptive to rewards and savings they can enjoy as a result of participating in the rewards program. Their strategy involves increasing their engagement and increasing their value to the organization over time.

The third category involves customers who could spend more but demonstrate a little engagement. They take fewer flights and use the loyalty program least, even though they can afford to. The strategy in this category involves converting their potential into real spending. The strategies include targeted welcome bonus schemes, rewarding them for redeeming their points for the first time, issuing them challenges for the short term to draw them in, and rewarding them in experiences centered on the program to get them more engaged with the program, thus contributing to the steady growth in their worth.

Overall, based on strategies adapted to the distinctiveness and capabilities of each group, AIAI will be ensured of better marketing, resource allocation, and the maximization of customer lifetime values. This approach provides a strong foundation for more focused, value-driven customer management and supports sustainable growth in a competitive market.
